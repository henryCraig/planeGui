#Alright so the plan here is to First make the GUI work
#And then I want to use pythons built in sql aspects to save previous plane searches
#Later on retrieve some maybe
#In this way I could have a list of interesting coordinates around the world

#One of the issues though is that I have to get the openSky API onto this computer

#plus how does that even work with creating an executable file?

#Heres something else thats fucking with me, I think my command prompt is in Python2, but anaconda is in Python3

The TWO tricky things I remember being tricky about this code is:
  You have to .pack, or use the geometry manager in someway after instantiating the button, or entry or whatever
    for some reason its not as easily manipulable if you just .pack on the line instantiating the entry or etc.
  The other tricky thing is that the whole thing is technically looping, which means loops don't really work in GUI's
    at least as far as I can tell

#Step 1.5: download the repo, and afterwards I can save it from there - DONE

#Step 1.7: install the repo from the folder, which is apparently considered the better way - DONE
  #I had to go to the python folder itself inside the API and then use the pip install command - DONE

#Step 2: Download geopy - DONE(done previously)


#Step 3: Get the GUI working with the plane code - DONE!

#Step 4: Error Checking - DONE! (I think?  hard to say if this kind of thing is finished)

#Step 4.5: Get access to dropbox - DONE!
  4.55: Use word in dropbox - DONE!
  4.56: Create a new file and folder for a 2019 project based resume - DONE!
  4.6: I would like to review a couple of articles on project based resumes
  4.7: and then I would like to start working on a more project based resume as well

#Step 5: Make it look good? - preferably
  #Step 5.0 - sketch out the thing I'm looking for, maybe look at some nice GUIs or some UX stuff
  Step 5.1: Create a new program that doesn't have any plane finding abilities, but does look good

#Step 6: Make it work with SQL would be nice.  That way I can show I can use SQL
  #Step 6.1 - try some SQL practice out again
  #Step 6.2 - Then try saving all the plane data with SQL, but WITHOUT the GUI
  #Step 6.3 - Then try using the GUI as well

#Step 7: hopefully make it an executable - DID IT!!!!!
  #Install CX-Freeze - DONE!
    #Needed to install directly from github by cloning the repo, luckily they had a pip install command
      So didnt need to do too much


#Last thing to do is add SQL to the thing I think

#I already have git installed because of the anaconda distro
